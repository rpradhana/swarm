> #### Task design for crowdsourcing platform
>
> In a crowdsourcing platform, a task is broken down into microtasks that are then assigned to
many workers, whose answers are aggregated to form the final answer to the original task. In
this project, we implement and evaluate task design strategies to determine their effectiveness.
The student will be required to build an online platform to demo the strategies.

## Build Setup
